I. CORE PRINCIPLES: LITHOSPHERIC SYSTEMS

The rock cycle functions as a closed-loop system of transformation: igneous (magmatic crystallization), sedimentary (lithification of depositional layers), and metamorphic (pressure/heat recrystallization). Plate tectonics serves as the macro-scale engine for crustal recycling, seismic activity, and orogenesis. Mineralogical identification is grounded in crystal habit, cleavage, and chemical composition.

II. FORENSIC METHODOLOGY: SEM-EDS

High-resolution analysis of the crustal micro-structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) resolves surface topography and morphology at sub-micron scales. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) identifies elemental signatures by capturing characteristic X-rays. This is utilized to detect high-entropy signals, such as shocked quartz or micro-spherules, which indicate catastrophic environmental events.

III. STRATIGRAPHY & IMPACT THEORY

The study of vertical sediment layers to isolate temporal markers. The Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB) is characterized by geochemical anomalies including platinum-group elements, nanodiamonds, and magnetic spherules. These markers serve as forensic evidence for high-velocity, high-temperature impacts that decouple from standard terrestrial depositional patterns.
